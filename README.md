# myUnitTester

I have developed an application resembling JUnit, a testing framework. This program executes a set of test methods and provides the user with the corresponding results, 
indicating success or failure. 
To ensure consistency, all test classes must implement the TestClass interface. 
Furthermore, it is essential that the constructor of each test class does not accept any parameters,
nor do its methods. Every method within the test class is expected to return a boolean value.
